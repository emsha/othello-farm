Othello AI - evolving populations of CNNs

Hello, my name is Max.

I'm interested neural nets. I'm building this project to try out some ideas I have and have found regarding the problem of optimizing hyperparameters. One of my inspirations (I found this after I started) for this project is NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT).

I want an unsupervised learning algorithm that can grow and adapt, and rigid hyperparameters certainly limit this goal. I believe that the ideal unsupervised learner requires no human influence to learn. Alpha Go Zero is an inspiration, how the tree search and nets pull eachother forward in training, but it still has a rigid shape. When I think about the 'ideal' learning altorithm, it's one that can grow to learn any problem, dig itself out of local minima, and walk in whatever direction it needs to to find a solution. Evolution has the potential to make unsupervised learners more robust to local (min/max)ima and its dynamic shape will allow for a flexible framework that can learn more problems more easily, and potentially faster.

For day to day thoughts and notes, check out plan.txt in the repo.
