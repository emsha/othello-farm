Othello AI - evolving populations of CNNs

Hello, my name is Max.

I'm interested in machine learning, particularly the edges of what we can do with neural nets. I'm building this project to try out some ideas I have and have found regarding the problem of optimizing hyperparameters. One of my inspirations (I found this after I started) for this project is NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT).

To me, in my heart of hearts, an unsupervised learning algorithm isn't 'pure' unless it can grow and adapt. From this purely emotion-based standpoint, rigid hyperparameters are a limitation. When I think about the 'ideal' learning altorithm, it's one that can grow to learn any problem, dig itself out of local minima, and grow in whatever direction it needs to.

I think that understanding and solving unsupervised learning problems has lots of potential, and that evolution of shape can potentially be one way to conquer hard problems efficiently and effectively.

For day to day thoughts and notes, check out plan.txt in the repo.
